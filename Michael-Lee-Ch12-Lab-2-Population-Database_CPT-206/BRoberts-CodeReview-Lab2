Your code seemed really long for this project. I don't remember learning some of the things you used in your code. There were plenty of comments to know what you were doing.
I didn't see any software defects that would cause this program to fail. But again it was long and I don't remember all of it.
Our solutions were very different. I used queries to get all of the data for my program which made it a lot shorter. There were some things I haven't seen before in your code.
Try not to over think the assignments and I think you will be ok.
