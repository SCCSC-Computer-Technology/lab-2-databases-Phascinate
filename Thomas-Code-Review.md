I cloned Michael’s repository and found no errors upon compilation. After running his program and testing it, I encountered no fatal errors. However, I found that the population field can have negative values entered into it via the data grid view. My solution to this problem would be to check if the population is greater than or equal to 0 before running the update query. Overall, I found the user experience to be nice.

Upon inspecting the code, I found that it had comments in most places. However, there were some blocks of code that lacked comments, such as lines 200-204 in MainForm.cs. Another thing that I noted was that there was an empty method in MainForm.cs at line 224.

In AddNewCityForm.cs, the SqlCommand object created on line 64 was disposed, but all of the other SqlCommand objects, found in MainForm.cs were not. While I am on the topic of SQL, the code to obtain statistics can be modularized further by creating a method that takes in a query and connection string and returns an object. An instance where this can be used is at lines 70-73 in MainForm.cs.

I like that Michael’s program has a more manual approach to queries and dealing with the data grid view. In my program, I allowed Visual Studio to set up the data grid view and its controls. With Michael’s approach, he has greater control over what happens to the database, but it does take more work to implement and may not be worth the extra work in some situations. My decision on whether to use his approach or mine would depend on the task at hand, but I think that his way would be more fun to implement.
